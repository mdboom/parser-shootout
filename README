This is a benchmark of some of the available Python parser tools as of
May 2013.

The following upfront criteria were used to select the candidates:

1] Pure Python
2] Works on Python 2.6 - 3.3
3] Uses a straighforward and well-understood parser type (this is of
   course subjective)
4] Maintained somewhat currently - it should have a somewhat
   obvious and active community around it (again, subjective)
5] Is licensing compatible to be distributed with astropy

Tools tested:

- pyparsing
- PLY

Tools on the short list to try next:

- parsing

Tools ruled out because they didn't meet the above criteria:

- PyPEG (no Python 2.6 support)
- Parsely (no Python 3.x support)
- YAPPS (no Python 3.x support)
- ANTLR (requires running a Java-based preprocessing step)
- aperiot (no Python 2.6 support)
- pydsl (GPL'd, no Python 2.6 support)
- lepl (self-declared unsupported)
- Rparse (GPL)
- CodeTalker (Cython-based, no Python 3.x support)
